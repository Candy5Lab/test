        <p>Hey there, I'm Candy, your friendly neighborhood UX/UI designer living it up in the bustling city of Bangkok! 
            <br> I'm a proud graduate of Industrial Design from Chulalongkorn University, currently rocking the design world at 
            <br> '5Lab,' cool tech company. ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è</p>

        <p>When I'm not crafting awesome user experiences, you can catch me grooving at concerts‚ÄîI'm all about that
            <br> alternative, indie, and rock life. 'Arctic Monkeys,' 'Phum Viphurit,' and the latest 'Domi and JD Beck' gig? 
            <br> Count me in! üé∂</p>

        <p>I also have my adorable sidekick, Pumpkin, the Beagle extraordinaire. She's my partner in crime and 
            <br> the real boss of the house. Outside the design realm, you'll find me doodling away with sketch and watercolors. 
            <br> I'm also a cartoon and anime aficionado, and my ears are always tuned in to quirky podcasts, especially those about
            <br> animals and all things fun. Zoos, aquariums, and scouting for scrumptious food are my go-to adventures.
            <br> Let's connect, share stories, and make the world a bit more colorful and exciting together! üåà‚ú®</p>
